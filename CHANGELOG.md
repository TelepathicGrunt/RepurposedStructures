### **(V.7.1.8 Changes) (1.20.1 Minecraft)**

#### Misc:
(Fabric/Quilt): Removed Forge loot modifier that slipped in Fabric/Quilt jar. Ideally, it'll just do nothing cause you know, 
 Forge isn't on. But turns own certain mods are forcibly loading Forge specific loot modifier files on Fabric/Quilt causing issues...
 Why? Idk. Anyway, json file is moved out of Fabric/Quilt jar because it's doing nothing anyway.
