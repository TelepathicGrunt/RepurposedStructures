### **(V.7.0.0 Changes) (1.20 Minecraft)**

#### Major:
Ported to 1.20

#### Structure Sets:
Added "allowed_chunk_count" option to my super exclusion zone feature to let pack makers force structures to spawn always 
 within a certain distance of another structure. It works with "chunk_count" option where if "allowed_chunk_count" is 
 present, it must be larger than "chunk_count" option. The structure will then  spawn only within allowed_chunk_count 
 distance but no closer than chunk_count away.

#### Loot Tables:
Added armor templates to equivalent RS structure's loot tables to match vanilla's.

#### Archaeology:
Added Suspicious Sand and Suspicious Gravel to Ocean Ancient City, Jungle Pyramid, all Overworld Land Ruins, and to all RS Wells.
