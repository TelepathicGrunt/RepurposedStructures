### **(V.6.3.20 Changes) (1.19.4 Minecraft) (Config Datapack Updated)**

#### Ancient City:
Removed invalid reference to non-existant wall piece for all RS Ancient Cities. Mojang bug that I imported: https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-249771


### **(V.6.3.18 Changes) (1.19.0-1.19.2 Minecraft) (Config Datapack Updated)**

#### Misc:
Adjusted the Cartographer maps to use tags so that Jungle Fortresses from compat datapacks can still be found.
 New compat datapacks for Yung's Better Nether Fortress and Apocalyptic Fortress are created now (might not be approved and visible yet)

Borrowed code from Async Locator mod so now RS's explorer maps in Wandering Traders and Cartographers are done off-thread!
 This means much less lag when the game is locating the structure for explorer maps trades that goes to RS structures.
