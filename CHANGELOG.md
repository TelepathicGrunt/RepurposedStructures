### **(V.6.3.16 Changes) (1.19.0-1.19.2 Minecraft)**

#### Misc:
Optimized pool_additions code for checking if a piece exists so it does not need to run through DFU.

Updated RS's NBT files to make loading the NBT files no longer need to run through DFU when the nbt files first loads.
 Special thanks to: https://github.com/SuperCoder7979/structure-fixer

Bumped version number so RS is same version number across all modloaders now for some sanity in my mess.
